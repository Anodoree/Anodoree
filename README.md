    My works :computer:

<p>
    <b>For about a year Iâ€™ve been studying on my own, but I just recently completed a paid course with mentor. While I'm preparing a good portfolio, please look at my old works from the following list (*from new to old):</b>
</p>
<ol reversed>
    <li>
        FreshOK (<a href="https://github.com/Anodoree/freshok">repo</a> / <a href="https://anodoree.github.io/freshok/">demo</a>) - online-market from "From 0 to 1" school. There are some comments on the product page, but since it will not be quoted in a serious portfolio, I decided to leave it this way;
    </li>
    <li>
        WAWE (<a href="https://github.com/Anodoree/wawe">repo</a> / <a href="https://anodoree.github.io/wawe/">demo</a>) - landing-page from "From 0 to 1" school;
    </li>
    <li>
        Solar (<a href="https://github.com/Anodoree/Solar">repo</a> / <a href="https://anodoree.github.io/Solar/">demo</a>) - written with youtube channel "From 0 to 1" but adaptation is fully mine with some edits in html and images compressing;
    </li>
    <li>
        Expertsender (<a href="https://github.com/Anodoree/expertsender">repo</a> / <a href="https://anodoree.github.io/expertsender/">demo</a>) - small independent work, written in pure html and css;
    </li>
    <li>
        Emails (<a href="https://github.com/Anodoree/Emails">repo</a> / <a href="https://anodoree.github.io/Emails/">demo</a>) - start of some attempts. Written independently following an example from a mailing list to personal mail. In general, the work is ready, but there are some rules that are not yet clear;
    </li>
    <li>
        Personal site (<a href="https://github.com/Anodoree/Personal-site">repo</a> / <a href="https://anodoree.github.io/Personal-site/">demo</a>) - a bit of initial knowledge of JavaScript;
    </li>
    <li>
        Kagayaku Karate (<a href="https://github.com/Anodoree/Kagayaku-Karate">repo</a> / <a href="https://anodoree.github.io/Kagayaku-Karate/">demo (beta v.2.09)</a> / <a href="https://kagayaku-karate.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">site (pure html/css, v.1)</a>) - was created as a business card without designer and any other help for my friend and is still being assembled. The previous version is currently working in web;
    </li>
    <li>
        Pakko (<a href="https://github.com/Anodoree/Pakko">repo</a> / <a href="https://anodoree.github.io/Pakko/">demo</a>) - the first place in adaptation contest:star: More info in repo;
    </li>
    <li>
